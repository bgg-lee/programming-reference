"""
You are given a 2D grid `M` of size R x C, consisting of characters '1' or '0'.
Each '1' represents land, and each '0' represents water.

Two '1' cells belong to the same island if they are connected *vertically or horizontally* 
(i.e., in 4 directions: up, down, left, right).

Your task is to count how many distinct islands of '1's are in the grid.
Return the total number of such islands.
